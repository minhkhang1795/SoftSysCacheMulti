## CacheMulti: Optimize matrix multiplication in C
#### Team members: Khang Vu, Yichen Jiang
### Project Goals:
The MVP of this project is to finish the tutorials, understand how to optimize matrix multiplication in code, and write matrix multiplication code that is more optimized than conventional methods.
Our medium range goal is to apply a divide and conquer algorithm with parallelization such as Strassen algorithm. 
The stretch goal involves understanding and utilizing a mesh network to optimize matrix multiplication. 

### Personal Learning Goals:
* Khang: I am interested in learning about different matrix multiplication algorithms and their tradeoffs in terms of time and space complexity. Also, I would like to be better at programming in C and learn some low-level specific topics such as memory parallelism and distributed computing for optimization.
* Yichen: My primary goal in this project is to become a better C programmer. I think because C is such a low-level language, learning C can help me understand more about other programming languages and how I can optimize my code for time and space efficiency. I am also very interested in linear algebra and it sounds fascinating to me to understand how the most fundamental operation in linear algebra, matrix multiplication, is implemented and optimized in C. I want to learn more about the intersection of math and programming through this project. 

### Resources:
We found the following resources that would help us start on the project. As the project progresses, we will find more reference resources and expand this list. 
* [Efficient matrix multipilication](https://gist.github.com/nadavrot/5b35d44e8ba3dd718e595e40184d03f0)
* [GEMM optimization tutorial](https://github.com/flame/how-to-optimize-gemm)
* [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/high-performance-scientific-computing-with-c/)
* [Strassen algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strassen_algorithm)
* [Coppersmithâ€“Winograd algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coppersmith%E2%80%93Winograd_algorithm)

### First steps:
For the first week of the project, we want to finish the section 1 and 2 of the Udemy course. And we also want to finish the matrix multiplication tutorials on Github to gain a better understanding of the topic.
