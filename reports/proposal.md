## CacheMulti: Optimize matrix multiplication in C
#### Team members: Minhkhang Vu, Yichen Jiang
### Project Goals:
Our MVP is to use caching and simple matrix operations (i.e. transpose) to optimize matrix multiplication. 
Our medium range goal is to apply a divide and conquer algorithm with parallelization such as Strassen algorithm. 
Stretch goal involves implementing the Coppersmith - Winograd algorithm

### Personal Learning Goals:
* Khang: I am interested in learning about different matrix multiplication algorithms and their tradeoffs in terms of time and space complexity. Also, I would like to be better at programming in C and learn some low-level specific topics such as memory parallelism and distributed computing for optimization.
* Yichen: My primary goal in this project is to become a better C programmer. I think because C is such a low-level language, learning C can help me understand more about other programming languages and how I can optimize my code for time and space efficiency. I am also very interested in linear algebra and it sounds fascinating to me to understand how the most fundamental operation in linear algebra, matrix multiplication, is implemented and optimized in C. I want to learn more about the intersection of math and programming through this project.
